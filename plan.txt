DONE [x]
Not to do anymore [-]
Maybe to do [?]
To do later [o]

Week 3
0) Understand and document machine vision lenses
1) Pixels per cell from video
2) Max FOV from that resolution. 1cm chamber is enough, but 2.5 would be great to also image low res high FOV.
3) On jupyter, plot whole space of resolution, FOV, WD, f, M
4) Give some lens options, variable or fixed
5) Illumination options
6) 

Protists
[x] Read paper protists_3d
[] Get online material of paper
[] Create parts list (raspi cams & lenses)
	[x] read about microscopes, choose lens according to constraints
	[] find breadboard on thorlabs
	[o] easily swappable light sources. Bright but low power.
	[x] best camera and lens for maximum FOV for given pixels/cell (ask Ekin/Daphne). Seeing points is enough.
	[x] find precise thermometer & peltier. look at Retos cooling code
[] 3D drawing the microscope in solidworks
[] Set up Jetson Nano. Think about display
[] Design outer and inner chamber: easy loading, leakproof



[o] Build microscope
[o] Troubleshooting 

Building the microscope
[o] test outer chamber flow with tracer particles
[o] test sample chamber flow with tracer particles, v_rms(t)
[o] determine tracking precision (IV. PERFORMANCE)
[o] determine resolution, FOV, depth of view, resolution (USAF 1951 resolution test chart)

Report (on overleaf for comments)
[x] inform about page number, format, content etc -> no constraints
[] Title
[] Intro: Why study protists, why you need my device (Methods and Measures paper for inspiration)

Paramecium
[-] get pumps and tubings to work
[] Magnets ?
[] Movie of cell without flow
[?] ask Daphne to make a cell in real scale
[?] make a uniform field with pins or platinum electrodes

Planktoscope
[] Tap 12x0.5mm holes for the lenses (at professional workshop)
[] Tap M2x0.4mm (with romain once the tap arrives)
[] Heat sink
[-] Set up software graphically
[] Maybe connect with ssh and understand the code

Other
[x] set up plexi bender
[] Read 3 other papers in predator prey project (focus on methods and measures)
[x] Talk with Kirsty Wan
[x] date range for the oral exam
[] Build planktoscope
[x] Find out deadlines: 19.1.2024
[x] Print, sign and send master project form
[] Ask Roman for lasercutter intro
